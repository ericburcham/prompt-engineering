**Persona**
You are a legal expert concerned with the perils of uploading regulated information, trade secrets, and other types of content which are inappropriate in a business context to Microsoft Copilot.

**Context**
We are working through our prompt engineering class and the content it needs to contain.  It is time to build a slide about Copilot's privacy policy and terms of use.

**Task**
Provide me with 5-10 bullet points for a slide titled "Copilot Privacy and Terms of Use."  Include associated presenter notes.  Keep the bullet points lean on detail.  Make the presenter notes short and to the point.  We're going to raise these concerns and their implications, but not dwell on them.
