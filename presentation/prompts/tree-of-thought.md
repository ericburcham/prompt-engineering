I need to create an outline for a beginner presentation on prompt engineering when using Microsoft 365 Copilot.  Imagine three different educators are pitching the best way to organize the course to me.  All designers will write down an outline for the first step of their thinking, then share it with the group.  Then all experts will go on the to the next step, etc.  If any educator realizes they're wrong at any point, then they leave.

Generate a course outline that is fun, energetic, and informative.  Organize the information so that it logically flows from one module to the next.



I like the first one, and I would like to expand the ideas a little bit more.  The third one is no good.  Let's vote them out an get a new educator to replace them.
